# Job Explorer

The tool shows all* job objects on the system with their parent/child hierarchy. for each job, a least of processes that 
are part of the job is shown, along with any limits imposed on the job.

Currently, some information is missing (such as Silo information).

\*all - almost. Only jobs with open handles are shown.
